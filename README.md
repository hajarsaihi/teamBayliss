# Team Bayliss 
# QMUL MSc Bioinformatics

Phospho Kinase was developed by Bayliss – a group of 4 students that are part of the MSc Bioinformatics Programme at Queen Mary University of London, under the supervision of Professor Conrad Bessant and Dr Fabrizio Smeraldi.

Phospho Kinase explores the functional annotation, phosphosites and functional description of protein kinases, the key controllers of cell behavior. We focus the full complement of protein kinases in any sequenced genome through a functional Kinase search engine. The kinase search engine is connected to an extensive database of Kinases including classification and kinase information. In addition, phospho kinase provides information about all phosphosites phosphorylated by all kinases across a platform of proteins. 


## Website Link

## Getting Started

To run the code on your localhost please download the file 'final_website'. 
Once downloaded please run the 'final_database_friha.py' to create and populate the database called 'final_data.db'.


### Prerequisites

The softwares required:

Python 3.6.0
requests==2.21.0
bokeh==1.0.4
Flask==1.0.2
flask_sqlalchemy==2.3.2
flask_table==0.5.0
matplotlib==3.0.2
numpy==1.16.1
pandas==0.24.1
SQLAlchemy==1.2.17
Werkzeug==0.14.1
WTForms==2.2.1
ipython==7.2.0

To install these:
```
pip install requests==2.21.0 
pip install bokeh
pip install Flask
pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy
pip install Flask-Table
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install SQLAlchemy
pip install Werkzeug
pip install WTForms
pip install ipython

```

### Running the website

In your commandline open the 'final_website' directory and run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

Copy the localhost URL and paste it into your browser (for best user experience please use Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome).

This would lead you to the homepage of 'Phospho Kinase'.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
